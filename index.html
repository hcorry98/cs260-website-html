        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a senior at BYU majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in
          artificial intelligence and full-stack development. I have experience
          doing back-end development at an electrical engineering firm, so I decided
          to take CS 260 as an elective to gain experience and knowledge about
          front-end and full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love to build things. Whether it's building FPV drones,
          doing metal or wood working, or 3D printing, I am happy. I love to play with
          my dog Tank. I'm also obsessed with golf, scuba diving, hammocking, and
          watching scary movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to start a career in full-stack development working closely
          with artificial intelligence. My dream is to go to grad school at MIT.
